## CS 416 Data Visualization, Summer 2023
### Narrative Visualization Project

The visualization is intended to comprise three "scenes":
1. Comparison of crime in Chicago and other U.S. cities
2. Trends in Chicago crime during 2016-2022
3. Breakdown of Chicago crimes by category and region. Chicago is divided into 9 named regions, such as the Northwest Side, West Side, Far Southeast Side, and so on.

Data were compiled from:  
- The data set "Crimes 2001 to the present" available through the City of Chicago data portal at https://data.cityofchicago.org/
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_cities_by_crime_rate
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_cities_by_population
