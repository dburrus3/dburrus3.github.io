There are three "scenes":
1. Comparison of Chicago with other U.S. cities
2. Trends in reported crimes during 2016-2022
3. Breakdown of crimes by category and location

The data set "Crimes 2001 to the present" available through the City of Chicago data portal at https://data.cityofchicago.org/
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_cities_by_crime_rate
